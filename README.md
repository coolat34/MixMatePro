Calculate area, volume and quantity of concrete required for a selection of common garden shapes
MixMate is a concrete calculator app designed to help estimate the amount of concrete needed for common garden shapes. The app provides a selection of geometric shapes as guides to calculate volume and materials required.

Upon launch, a reference table is displayed, showing the density and mix ratios (Basic, Medium, Strong) used in the calculations. Users can select from shapes such as a slab (box), round cylinder, segment, elliptical round (wedge), and open cylinder.

The default unit of measurement is metres, but users can switch to millimetres, centimetres, inches, or feet. After entering the shape’s dimensions, the app calculates both the area and volume. It also estimates the required quantities of cement, sand, and aggregate, broken down into bag sizes of 20kg, 25kg, and 30kg. All quantities are rounded up for practical use.

To use the app, simply input the shape’s measurements and tap Continue. You can then choose the desired mix strength — Basic, Medium, or Strong — based on your project requirements.
