# MixMatePro
Calculate area, volume and quantity of concrete required for a selection of common garden shapes
MixMatePro is a concrete calculator app designed to help estimate the amount of concrete needed for common garden shapes. The app provides a selection of general shapes as guides to calculate volume and materials required.

Upon launch, a reference table is displayed, showing the density and mix ratios (Basic, Medium, Strong) used in the calculations. Users can select from shapes such as a slab (box), round cylinder, segment, elliptical round (wedge), half cylinder and open cylinder.

The default unit of measurement is dependent on the country that is using the App. Within the US the measurements will be in feet or inches and the resulting bags will be 40lb, 60lb or 80lb. Other countries will be offered millimetres, centimetres and metres with the resulting bags in 20kg, 25kg and 30kg.  However, the unit of measurement can be toggled. After entering the shape’s dimensions, the app calculates both the area and volume. It also estimates the required quantities of cement, sand, and aggregate, broken down into bag sizes varying in 3 weights. All quantities are rounded up to the nearest 1/3 bag for practical use.
The default strength is a Basic mix but this can be altered to Medium or Strong.

To use the app, simply input the shape’s measurements via the hand-crafted numeric keypad and tap Next Screen. You can then choose the desired mix strength — Basic, Medium, or Strong — based on your requirements.
